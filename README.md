# House Pricing and Sales Trends in King County

This project analyzes housing data from King County, Washington, to understand market trends, identify key factors affecting house prices, and build predictive models for house pricing.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of housing features and market trends
- Feature engineering and selection
- Predictive modeling using machine learning
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Business insights for real estate stakeholders

## Dataset

The project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which includes:
- House features (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.)
- Location data (zipcode, latitude, longitude)
- Sale prices and dates
- Property characteristics (condition, grade, etc.)
